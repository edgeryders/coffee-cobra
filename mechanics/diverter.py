        A parametric rotary object diverter to be mounted over conveyor units.

        :param workplane: The CadQuery workplane to create this part on.
        :param measures: The measures to use for the parameters of this design. Expects a nested 
            [SimpleNamespace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace) 
            object, which may have the following attributes:
            - **``shovel.size``:** Width of the shovel's opening.
            - **``shovel.height``:** Height of the shovel.
            - **``shovel.cavity``:** Depth of the deepest part of the shovel, measured to a line 
                connecting its edges.
            - **``shovel.inclination``:** Angle in radial direction against vertical. Positive 
                angle lean towards the center, negative away from it.

        .. todo:: Add the shaft mount.
        .. todo:: Use rectangular through-holes for dropping in nuts into the right half of the 
            shaft collar. Less fiddly than hexagonal holes from the back. And removing less material.
        .. todo:: Move calculations of derived measures into the initializer.
        .. todo:: Fix that the upper wire of the shovels does not reach in radially inside as much as 
            it should. That is because it is drawn on an inclined plane, which shortens its 
            effective radial length. When placing a cylinder into the center that should fill the 
            space, there is no gap to the shovels at the bottom, but at the top there is.
        .. todo:: Change the orientation of the part by rotating it 90Â° on the z axis. That will 
            give proper meanings to the measures nuthole_width, nuthole_depth, nuthole_depth_position.
            However, maybe the measures should not refer to the global part orientation, cf. 
            "depth of a hole", which is always a local measure. In that case, rename the measures.
