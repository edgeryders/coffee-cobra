        A parametric shaft coupling of the Spider / Lovejoy type, without a rubber insert.

        :param workplane: The CadQuery workplane to create this part on.
        :param measures: The measures to use for the parameters of this design. Expects a nested 
            [SimpleNamespace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace) 
            object, which may have the following attributes:
            - **``TODO``:** TODO

        .. todo:: Fix that the cog generation code only works for 4 and 6 cogs so far.
        .. todo:: Make the cogs rounded or pointed at the top so that two parts will usually 
            come together under light pressure without having to turn one manually.
        .. todo:: Add a parameter to also use a rubber insert, allowing to create a backlash-free 
            coupling.
        .. todo:: Add a parameter to configure the size of the circular cutout between the cogs.
        .. todo:: Determine a default for clamp_lenght automatically if no measure is given.
        .. todo:: Make the 3D printer bridging distance configurable. Currently, a constant value 
            of 4 mm is used in Workplane::shaft(â€¦, top_diameter = 4).
